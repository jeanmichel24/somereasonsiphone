    <h2>
      The new iPhone 15 seems innovative compared to the iPhone 14: USB-C
      connector, "dynamic island" cutout in the middle of the screen, 48MP
      camera. A reason to upgrade your old iPhone? Here are a few reasons not
      to.

            At the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiP1l7jlIIA">presentation</a> on September 12, Apple presented a new generation of professional smartphones iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. The update is difficult to call revolutionary, the devices differ from last year's models by only a small set of features. It is definitely not necessary to change from the iPhone 14 Pro for their sake, but you can switch to the new models from an older device.

          Apple has praised the camera of the iPhone 15 Pro so highly, yet it
          seems to have forgotten about the display. Yes, it has become brighter
          - 2000 nits under direct sunlight, so now you can easily browse memes
          while standing in the street in the summer. However, they did not add
          a 120Hz refresh rate, so we have to make do with the standard 60Hz.

          Yes, Apple has replaced the Lightning connector with USB-C. One of the
          key innovations in the lineup is the switch from Lightning to USB-C.
          This is a plus for those who work with other Apple products and
          third-party devices, such as Android smartphone s, on a daily basis.
          Additionally, you can now charge headphones and watches from your
          phone. High-speed data transfer should not be expected.

          Both iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 can record 4K video at up to 60fps with HDR Dolby Vision, and they have similar capabilities in Cinematic mode, Action mode, and slo-mo video recording. The video recording capabilities are quite similar between the two models, which means if you're primarily interested in video, the iPhone 14 might still suffice

        <b>To take or not to take?</b> <br />
        The main question - is it worth buying a new smartphone or is it better
        to stay this year without an upgrade? It seems that there are no serious
        reasons to move to the iPhone 15 Pro. Except in two cases. The first -
        you are a connoisseur of portable gaming, the second - you need optical
        zoom. If you have an iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 14 Pro Max, there's no
        point in upgrading to the next generation - there aren't many changes.
        Even iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max owners can safely skip the 2023
        lineup. The performance of the two-year-old models is still enough for
        everything.Other improvements will come to the iPhone 14 Pro along with
        the release of iOS 17.
